## Call for Papers
{: #call }

We invite submissions in the primary areas listed above. FSML 2026 offers two distinct tracks for participation.

### 1. Workshop Track (Non-archival)

This track is for new research ideas or work-in-progress.

- **Format:** Extended abstracts of **3–5 pages** (excluding references/appendices).
- **Review Process:** Double-blind peer review.
- **Dual Submission:**
  - **Published:** Previously published work must be substantially extended to be considered.
  - **Under Review:** Papers currently under review elsewhere may be submitted without extension (but must still confirm to 3–5 pages).
- **Submission:** [Submit via OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=your-link)

### 2. Fast Track (Recent Publications)

This track is for papers recently accepted at major venues (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) after **[Month] 2025**. Fast Track is non-archival and does not have proceedings to avoid conflict with other venues’ double submission policies.

- **Format:** Submit the original **camera-ready PDF** (with author names included).
- **Selection:** Based on original acceptance; no new peer review.
- **Submission:** [Submit via Google Form](https://your-google-form-link)

**Presentation Format:** Accepted submissions from both tracks will be presented in-person as posters.
