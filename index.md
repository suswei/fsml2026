## Overview
{: #overview }

Building on the success of last year's inaugural launch ([FSML 2025](https://fsmlims.wixsite.com/fsml25)), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) is proud to present the **2026 Frontiers in Statistical Machine Learning (FSML)** workshop.

This annual series continues its mission to spotlight emerging and impactful topics in statistical machine learning that are rapidly evolving but have yet to receive significant attention in leading IMS and ASA publications. Each year, FSML focuses on specific core themes to encourage the dissemination of novel ideas and foster deeper engagement within the community.

Inspired by the dynamic format of machine learning conference workshops, FSML brings a fresh and interactive approach to the statistics landscape. The workshop hosts an open call for short paper submissions, followed by a rigorous and transparent review process.

**New for 2026:** We are introducing a **Fast Track** submission option for papers recently accepted at major machine learning venues (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML). This addition aims to bridge the gap between communities by showcasing high-impact ML work to a broader statistical audience.

The 2026 program highlights two core themes:

- **Area 1:** TBA
- **Area 2:** Science of Deep Learning
  - **Theoretical Foundations:** Exploring mathematical and statistical principles underlying deep learning.
  - **Phenomenological Studies of Learning Systems:** Cataloging and explaining intriguing behaviors in learning dynamics.
  - **Interpretability, Alignment, and Safety:** Understanding and guiding AI systems to ensure ethical and safe operation.
  - **Emerging Learning Paradigms:** Investigating new approaches, such as in-context learning and scaling laws.

## Call for Papers
{: #call }

We invite submissions in the primary areas listed above. FSML 2026 offers two distinct tracks for participation.

**Presentation Format:** Accepted submissions from both tracks will be presented in-person as posters.

**Non-archival**: Both tracks are non-archival. 

### 1. Workshop Track (Non-archival)

This track is for new research ideas or work-in-progress.

- **Format:** Extended abstracts of **3–5 pages** (excluding references/appendices).
- **Review Process:** Double-blind peer review.
- **Dual Submission:**
  - **Published:** Previously published work must be substantially extended to be considered.
  - **Under Review:** Papers currently under review elsewhere may be submitted without extension (but must still confirm to 3–5 pages).
- **Submission:** [Submit via OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=your-link)

### 2. Fast Track (Recent Publications)

Papers recently accepted at major ML venues (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, JMLR, TMLR) after **[Month] 2025** are eligible for the Fast Track.

- **Format:** Submit the original **camera-ready PDF** (with author names included).
- **Selection:** Fast Track submissions are selected based on eligibility and fit with the FSML workshop themes; no additional peer review is conducted.
- **Submission:** [Submit via Google Form](https://your-google-form-link)
